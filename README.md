## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS variables

### What I learned

- That project made me learn about semantic HTML5

- Working with flexible display using the flexbox properties, positioning elements on the screen.

- Working with external fonts (Google fonts) to improve a better custom apparence.

- Working with separated documents, improving organization and responsability to every document with its function in the whole project.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="src/styles/reset.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="src/styles/variables.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="src/styles/style.css" />
```

- Working with variables reducing the code and establishing a pattern easiest to manage.

```CSS
:root {
 --soft-blue: hsl(215, 51%, 70%);
  --cyan: hsl(178, 100%, 50%);

  --main-BG: hsl(217, 54%, 11%);
  --card-BG: hsl(216, 50%, 16%);
  --line: hsl(215, 32%, 27%);
  --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --paragraph: hsl(215, 51%, 70%);
}
```
